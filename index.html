        <h2><em><strong>Graphic Designer</strong></em></h2>
        <p><em>Design begins pretty much in the same place that a road trip begins. <br>
          Before you take a trip, the first and most important thing you need to know is where you're going. <br>
          I mean, it doesn't matter how efficiently you pack or how well you drive, <br>
          if you don't know where you're going, you're not going to get there. <br>
          So, let's find out your story together. In fact the knowing your story is where design begins, <br>
          and it's the key to visual communication.</em></p>
        <p>My name is Daria Batrak. I'm a graphic designer since 2010. <br>
          I've worked in five newspapers as DTP specialist. <br>
          Also I've filled the graphic content and e-mail distribution for online stores. <br>
          And In recent years, I work in the advertising industry. <br>
          I create presenters, banners, billboards, product labels, leaflets, calendars and so on.</p>
